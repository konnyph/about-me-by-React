      <p>
      My name is Konny and I'm a passionate learner with a growing interest in the world of coding. While it may be a new subject to me, I find myself enjoying it more and more every day. As someone who loves to challenge themselves, I see coding as both a fun and stressful experience, constantly pushing me to learn and grow. I'm excited to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge of coding through this bootcamp, and I look forward to all the possibilities that lie ahead.
